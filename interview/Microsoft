Microsoft Interview
-------------------

1. Implement a data structure where -
    - insertion of new elements is done in O(1) time
    - deletion of new elements is done in O(1) time
    - write a function that fetches a random element among all elements in O(1) time

2. Given a sorted list of positive integers, find the kth missing number in this list compared to the sequence of positive integers
    Eg - Given { 5, 6, 8, 10, 11}
         Missing numbers - 1 2 3 4 7 9 12 13 ...
         5th missing number - 7

3. What is a Spin Lock and write an implementatio of spin lock

4. Given a list of numbers, find the top 'k' repeated numbers i.e the most frequent numbers
    Eg - Given { 4 8 9 4 4 9 3 8 7 3 }
         k = 3 - Top 3 repeated numbers - { 4 8 9 } or { 4 9 3 } or { 4 8 3 } 
         k = 4 - Top 4 repeated numbers - { 4 8 9 3 }
         k = 1 - Top 1 repeated number - { 4 }
