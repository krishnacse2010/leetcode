Problem
-------
In a school, there are 5 sections for a specific standard. You are given the list of scores of students for each of the 5 sections arranged by the top scores.
Generate an overall ranking of scores across the 5 sections.

Interpretation
--------------
5 arrays of integers are given corresponding to scores of students of 5 sections. These arrays are already sorted in descending order.
Make one more result array with all the 5 arrays combined and it should be in descending order

Solution
--------
Take the first element of each of the arrays and insert into a max heap with O(n) time.
Retrieve the top element of the max heap with O(1) time and fill into the result array
Fill the heap with the next element from the array which was selected as the max element
